  <p>There are so many ways to make your computer superfast but it as well depends on what you do with your computer.
     If you apply the following tips then you will experience what I call superspeed.

You need to increase your computer RAM size to a much higher memory size probably 32 Gigabytes or less Because it
 is the <em>RAM that stores</em> temporary data on the computer and also provide quick access to files that the computer <b>
 is actively reading or writing.</b>
You can as well need to change your Hard Disk to an higher disk size. However the Hard Disk works in
 conjunction with the RAM but takes care of long- term storage unlike the RAM </br> brbbrbb
And lastly if you are not a gaming freak you can change your computerâ€™s Operating System to a Linux
 open source Operating System such as Ubuntu Linux, Linux Mint or openSUSE etc. to increase your computer speed.</p>
